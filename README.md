##About
Tuberculosis - also known as 'consumption' - is one of the world's deadliest killers. 2-3 million people fall succumb to it each year even though we have a cure! Why? A multitude of factors impact this such as: proper diagnosis, living conditions, and patient compliance. The treatment plan for Tuberculosis (TB) is a lengthy one, ranging from 6 to 9 months IF diagnosed correctly. That's a long time to take pills consistently. We all know how hard it is building a gym routine, imagine how hard it must be to take multiple drugs each day. And if you miss a day, the bacteria might develop drug-resistance!

Drug-resistance is a huge problem. It's such a big problem that patients are usually asked to come into the hospital to take their medication. This puts a lot of burden on the healthcare system and on the patient themselves. TB usually affects people living in lower-income conditions. People whom it really impacts if they can't go to work or have to take time off work. We were inspired to bring automation to this problem.

##What it does

Tuber! is an app that allows the patient to send proof of drug intake to their doctor. It works by the user showing their pill, which the app will classify into the correct drug class. Once the user consumes the pill, a database which the doctor has access to will be updated with the time of their last intake.
